			<p style="font-size: 40px"> Objective & Overview</p>
			<br>
			<p> The mission of this project is to improve an existing interface that is widely used in everyday life by
				gathering data about user experience. 
				This project will handle the self-checkout machine. I made user observations in order to discover potential
				problems that may occur in the process of using the original interface. Using those observations, I was able to
				find areas that could be improved on and create an interface that may solve some of the problems</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 40px"> Questions/Interview</p>
			<br>
			<p>I went to a local marketplace and observed multiple users' interactions with the self-checkout machine.
				I interviewed 3 individuals to further understand their expectations, experiences, motives, and challenges.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Key Observations</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
					<li>People at the self-checkout spent less time checking out compared to the cashier checkout</li>
					<li>Users mostly had 2-6 items at the self-checkout</li>
					<li>All users used a debit/credit card instead of cash</li>
					<li>Users that faced difficulties were older than average customers</li>
				</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Interview Q&A</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Why did you decide to use this interface?</li>
				Only buying a couple of items so it is more convenient to use the self-checkout machine<br>
				There is less of a line compared to the cashier checkout<br>
				Do not enjoy interacting with the cashier	
				<li>What did you expect to achieve when you are done using this interface?</li>
				Purchase the items in a timely manner<br>
				Able to leave the store with the purchased items
				<li>Did you have any problem in the process of reaching those goals?</li>
				No: Was able to purchase the items quickly<br>
				Yes: There were some items that had barcodes placed in unexpected locations<br>
				Yes: There was not enough space in the bagging area so I placed the items on the floor. 
				The machine demanded to place the items in the bagging area causing delays.
				<li>Was there any confusion using this interface the first time you used it?</li>
				No: It was self explanatory<br>
				Yes: It was hard to find the barcode on some items
				<li>What improvements would you like to see from this interface?</li>
				Quicker process in general<br>
				Larger bagging area<br>
			</ol>

			<p style="font-size: 40px"> Sketch of the Interface</p>

			<p>
				It was clear to see that people who use self-checkout prefer speedy checkouts. Some obstacles that may interfere
				with this goal include bagging and scanning problems. The new interface I designed aims to solve the scanning problem.
				It is a hole that you can put your item into. It will have a reflective light trying to detect the barcode from
				every side of the object except the top. Ultimately, this should prevent the users from spending too much time trying
				to find the barcode as they have an alternative solution.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 40px"> Personas</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I used an empathy map to construct two personas that represent the target users.
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src="LexiEmpathyMap.jpg" alt="Empathy Map #1">
			<br>
			<p>Lexi is an old user who is not proficient in technology. Even though the self-checkout machine is one of the 
				simipler machines, people like Lexi can still struggle. The newly designed interface "Scan Hole" can help
				users who struggle with barcodes by making the process much easier. Even if the user does not locate the barcode,
				the user can put the item inside of the hole and it will still be scanned.
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src="BobEmpathyMap.jpg" alt="Empathy Map #2">
			<br>
			<p>Bob is a great representation of most users of the self-checkout machine. Most of the users do not face much
				difficulties using the interface. However, if other users in front of you struggles with the interface,
				even though Bob can complete the purchase quickly, he needs to wait for the users in front of him. The new
				interface can indirectly help people like Bob who does not want to wait too long for other users.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 40px"> Storyboard</p>
			<br>
			<p>I chose Lexi for the Storyboard as users like Lexi directly benefits from the new interface.</p>
			<br>

			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 40px"> Reflection</p>
			<br>
			<p>It is hard to say how successful this interface would be as I have not created a physical model nor
				performed clinical tests among users. However, this type of improvement has nothing to lose.
				Hole scan does not take any extra space as it would be a flat surface without the hole; the space will
				be taken regardless. Hole scan rather offers an alternative solution for users who struggle to find the barcode. Most
				users who are proficient in technology can continue to use the scanner on the front.
